# cspeakes_enumerator.py
-----------------------

Cspeakes_emulator is a tool for doing some very basic but robust general enumeration commands I use for initial discovery. Usage is simple as you need only supply the target IP address:

[+] ```~# python3 cspeakes_enumerator.py <target_ip>```

##### Please Note:

* This is my very first iteration, so be gentle. More will come with time.
* There are notes in the code as well, to help with further customization.
* There are currently no options, simply supply the script with a target ip.
 ... & Please Be Patient... It takes a bit to run all the tests (~20ish min).
 ... & Don't Worry.. It outputs to screen and to text files for later review.


##### Disclaimer:

Gotta be that guy real quick....
 
 This is a script that performs passive AND active information gathering tasks. DO NOT use this script to target any ip's, businesses, or organizations that you do not have explicit permission to target! IT IS ILLEGAL!
  ##### I take NO responsibility for the use of this script as it was created for cyber security research/testing and educational uses only.
  
There. Done being that guy.
